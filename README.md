# EcoLabLib
*EcoLabLib* is a library doing all work for *Labcontrol*, which functions just as graphical user interface to *EcoLabLib*. Together they shall support and simplify the conduction of economic experiments. *EcoLabLib* offers the following functionality:

* Booting and shutting down clients
* Starting and killing *z-Leaves* on the clients
* Managing one or multiple instances of *z-Tree* and their connected clients
* Automatic receipts creation and printing according to different templates
* Conducting administrative tasks on the clients
* Displaying the laboratory's webcams
* Opening *ORSEE*
* Displaying the clients' file systems in a file manager

To work properly *EcoLabLib* and *Labcontrol* have to be installed and configured on the server and *ClientClient* on the clients. To be able to show the laboratory's webcams *WebcamDisplay* should also be installed.

Currently *EcoLabLib* and the supporting programs are only known to work on Linux. A Linux server with Windows clients was already tested and worked fine. If you try to install *EcoLabLib* and its supporting programs on Windows contact us and we will gladly try to support you.
