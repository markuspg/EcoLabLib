# EcoLabLib

## Installation

Create two new directories, one to contain all files needed by *EcoLabLib* (e.g. */usr/share/ecolablib*) and another one to place all *z-Tree* executables in (e.g. */opt*). All *z-Tree* executables have to be placed in sub-directories of the second one following the naming scheme *zTree_X.Y.Z*. Otherwise the automatic detection of the installed *z-Tree* versions will not work.

On *Linux* create the folder */etc/xdg/Economic Laboratory* and copy the *EcoLabLib.conf* file from the *data* directory there. Afterwards edit all values according to your laboratory's setup.
